# Python package for M17 radio and radio-over-IP protocols


[![Build Status](https://drone.mmcginty.me/api/badges/mike/pyM17/status.svg?ref=refs/heads/master)](https://drone.mmcginty.me/mike/pyM17)


Full python support for handling M17 addresses, framing and parsing,
and including a full Python native VoIP client.

M17 is a new, experimental radio protocol similar to DMR/MotoTRBO, P25, D-STAR, and others.
It uses the Codec2 vocoder by David Rowe.

Use this Python (Py3 only) package to implement or integrate M17 systems,
or if you need more performance or embedded support, please check out
